**Part 1**

This is the code I used to write StringServer

Handle request is called 5 times in this code. The first call returns an empty string, and the other 4 append the query plus a newline character after it. "Hello" is called upon 3 times and appended to the website, then "How are you" is added. After each url is inputted, the value of str gets longer and longer

This screenshot is the same, except Handle request is called a 6th time, adding "googoogaga" plus a newline character after it. str is once again added to.


**Part 2**

I'll be using reverseInPlace as the method to focus Part 2 of my lab report on.

Failure-inducing input:
