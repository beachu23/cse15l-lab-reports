Today's lab will be focused on the command: ```grep```.

We will be examining 4 different ways to utilize this command. All commands will be run on the **technical** folder provided.

1. ```-e``` option

Input a:

```
grep -e "suicide" -e "temperate" 911report/chapter-1.txt
```

Output:
```
    Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run.
the hijacking would take the traditional form: that is, it would not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the aircraft into a guided missile.
```

Comments: The command allows ```grep``` to search for multiple string patterns in the file. If either pattern shows up in the file, the line will be included in the output. 

Input b:

```
grep -e "suicide"  911report/chapter-1.txt
```

Output: 

```
the hijacking would take the traditional form: that is, it would not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the aircraft into a guided missile.
```

Comments: If only one string is passed to ```grep```, it will function as if the ```-e``` option does not exist. In other words, it will simply search for the one string presented.

chatGPT prompt:

> give me an option with grep that can specify multiple patterns to match


chatGPT response:

> Certainly! To specify multiple patterns to match with grep, you can use the -e option. Here's an example:
> ``` 
> grep -e "pattern1" -e "pattern2" file.txt
> ```
> In this example, grep will search for lines that contain either "pattern1" or "pattern2" in the file file.txt. You can specify as many patterns as needed by 
> using multiple -e options followed by the respective pattern.
> 
> For instance, if you want to search for lines that contain either "apple," "banana," or "orange," you can use the following command:
> ```
> grep -e "apple" -e "banana" -e "orange" file.txt
> ```
> grep will display all lines from file.txt that match any of the specified patterns.


2. ```-c ``` option

Input a:

```
grep -c "suicide" 911report/chapter-1.txt 911report/chapter-2.txt
```

Output:

```
911report/chapter-1.txt:1
911report/chapter-2.txt:3
```

Comments: ```-c``` counts the number of lines where the text appears in the file. In the case of multiple files, it'll list the file relative path, as well as the numnber of times it's appeared
Input b:

```
grep -c "suicide" 911report/chapter-11.txt
```

Output: 

```
10
```

Comments: As we see, on one file, only the number appears

chatGPT prompt:
> give me some more ways to use grep, listing only the option commands without code

chatGPT response:
> Certainly! Here are some more grep options that you can use:
> -c: Count the number of matching lines instead of displaying them.
> -H: Print the filename along with the matched lines when searching in multiple files.
> -r: Recursively search directories and their subdirectories for matching patterns.
> -x: Match the entire line, rather than just a substring. Useful for exact matches.
> -s: Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
> -E: Interpret the pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE). Allows for more advanced pattern matching.
> 
> These additional options expand the functionality of grep and provide more flexibility in your text searching and manipulation tasks.




3.  ```-B``` option

Input a:

```
grep -B 1 "terrorist" 911report/chapter-10.txt
```

Output:

Comments: I was curious to see what would happen if I put ```-B 0```. ```grep``` will simply return the line where the detected string appears.

4.  ```$``` modifier

Input a:

```
grep ";$" 911report/chapter-10.txt
```

Output:

```

                    necessary military and intelligence operations;
                    other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda;
                to provide the United States with intelligence information;
                to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts;
```

Comments: ```n$``` where n is a string or character, returns all lines that end with n. In this case, I wanted to find all lines that ended with a semicolon in a file.

Input b:

```
grep "ide.$" 911report/chapter-11-txt 911report/chapter-12.txt 911report/chapter-6.txt
```

Output: 

```
911report/chapter-12.txt:                    development of an integrated system, which in turn can become part of the wider
911report/chapter-12.txt:                    terrorist attacks, the layers of security in place, and the reliability provided

```

Comments: This command also works with multiple files, where the file where the line is found is listed on the left hand side. Additionally, it works with strings as well as single characters.
